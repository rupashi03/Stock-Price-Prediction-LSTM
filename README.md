# Stock-Price-Prediction-LSTM-ARIMA

This project uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to predict the stock prices of five major companies: Microsoft, Tesla, Apple, Tata Beverages, and Facebook. The project demonstrates the use of time series analysis to predict future stock prices based on historical data.

The results from LSTM and ARIMA are compared to evaluate their predictive performance, with the finding that LSTM outperforms ARIMA for this particular use case.

<h3>Key Features</h3>
<li>LSTM Model: A deep learning-based model for predicting stock prices using historical data.</li>
<li>Performance Comparison: To show that LSTM is more accurate than historical models for time series analysis.</li>
