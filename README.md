# Stock-Price-Prediction-LSTM-ARIMA

This project uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models to predict the stock prices of five major companies: Microsoft, Tesla, Apple, Tata Beverages, and Netflix. The project demonstrates the use of time series analysis to predict future stock prices based on historical data.

The results from LSTM and ARIMA are compared to evaluate their predictive performance, with the finding that LSTM outperforms ARIMA for this particular use case.

Key Features
LSTM Model: A deep learning-based model for predicting stock prices using historical data.
ARIMA Model: A statistical method for time series forecasting, used for comparison with LSTM.
Performance Comparison: A comparison of prediction accuracy between LSTM and ARIMA.

Technologies Used
Python
TensorFlow/Keras (for LSTM model)
Statsmodels (for ARIMA model)
Pandas (for data manipulation)
NumPy (for numerical operations)
Matplotlib (for visualizations)
